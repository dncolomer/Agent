**Builder Agents**
X we wanna drop description / version and tags from the project specs in the config
X What do you do with the project info
X drop max files
X move max_runtime_min and max_cost_usd to the constraints block for build
X What do these constrains do? Stop? / warn?
X I wanna be able to define how many agents of each model
X I wanna be able to support local models as well
X How are all the "build" properties used in the code. Show me where they are loaded and used
- ? how do we wanna think about loging?


**Verifier Agents**
- I wanna be able to define how many agents of each model
- I wanna be able to support local models as well
- note to self: Think what to do about temperature in general
- remove path / target_rps / timeout_sec
- remove the fix options for test types. klets work with test goals instead
-- I wanna be able to define (via prompt) a test goal for any given test agent. Essentially define verifier agent types with goals and then be able to specific how many of each type.
-- The testing goal should be a prompt

**Operator Agents**
