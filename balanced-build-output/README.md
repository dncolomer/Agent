# Content Management System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based content management system (CMS) that combines a clean, accessible front-end with a robust, well-documented Python/JavaScript backend and a scalable database schema. The CMS will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and publishing various types of content, such as articles, blog posts, media files, and more.

## Backend Services

The backend of the CMS is built using Python and JavaScript. It handles the core business logic, data processing, and integration with the database. The main backend services include:

1. **Content Management Service**: Responsible for managing the creation, editing, and deletion of content items. It handles content validation, formatting, and storage.

2. **User Management Service**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and user profile management.

3. **Media Management Service**: Manages the upload, storage, and retrieval of media files (images, videos, documents, etc.).

4. **Search Service**: Provides full-text search capabilities for content and media items.

5. **Analytics Service**: Collects and analyzes user interactions, content engagement, and system performance metrics.

## Architecture

The CMS follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The backend services are designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily maintainable. The frontend communicates with the backend services through well-defined RESTful APIs.

The database schema is designed to accommodate various types of content, user data, and metadata. It supports efficient querying, indexing, and data retrieval.

## Installation

To set up the CMS locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cms.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the database connection settings in `config.py`
4. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for the backend services, APIs, and database schema can be found in the `docs` directory. This includes API reference, deployment guides, and architectural diagrams.
