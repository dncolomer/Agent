# Multi-Modal Verification Configuration for a Simple TODO App
# This configuration sets up specialized builder and operator agents
# to create and verify a simple in-memory TODO application.

project:
  name: simple-todo-app

# High-level objective shared by ALL agents
overarching_team_goal: >
  Create a simple, functional TODO application with an in-memory backend,
  a clean user interface, and clear startup instructions. The app should
  be simple but functional, with proper error handling and a clean user
  interface.

# Builder and operator agents
agents:
  # Builder 1 – backend
  - type: builder
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.3
    goal: >
      Implement an in-memory Flask API with CRUD routes.

  # Builder 2 – frontend
  - type: builder
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.3
    goal: >
      Build a simple React UI that talks to the API.

  # Builder 3 – documentation / start-up
  - type: builder
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.3
    goal: >
      Create a clear README with install & run instructions plus any helper
      startup scripts.

  # Operator 1 – end-to-end tester
  - type: operator
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.15
    goal: >
      Ensure backend and frontend integrate flawlessly; validate CRUD
      functionality and error handling.

  # Operator 2 – documentation tester
  - type: operator
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.15
    goal: >
      Execute the README instructions on a clean environment and confirm
      the app starts and operates as documented. Report any ambiguities or
      missing steps.

  # Operator 3 – route tester
  - type: operator
    model: google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest
    count: 1
    temperature: 0.15
    goal: >
      Start the app locally and perform basic HTTP GET requests to key
      routes (/, /api/todos). Confirm each route returns expected HTML or
      JSON with status 200, not error pages or stack traces.
