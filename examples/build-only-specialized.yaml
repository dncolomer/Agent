# Build-Only Specialized Configuration
# This configuration focuses exclusively on build agents with specialized roles
# using different OpenRouter models for specific tasks.

# Project metadata
project:
  name: specialized-build-demo

# Builder agents configuration with specialized OpenRouter models
build:
  # High-level objective shared by **all** builder agents
  overarching_team_goal: >
    Build a modern data-analytics platform featuring real-time visualisation
    dashboards, a responsive and accessible UI, and pluggable connectors for
    multiple data sources (SQL, NoSQL, streaming).
  agents:
    count: 7  # Total number of builder agents
    # Define specific models and specialized roles
    models:
      - name: openai/gpt-4o
        count: 2  # Architecture and complex logic specialists
        temperature: 0.2  # Low temperature for precise architectural decisions
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Design the overall system architecture and implement critical
          algorithms to ensure efficient, scalable data processing.
      - name: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
        count: 2  # UI/UX component specialists
        temperature: 0.6  # Higher temperature for creative UI solutions
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Develop responsive, accessible UI components and maintain a strong
          focus on user-experience principles.
      - name: google/gemini-pro
        count: 1  # Data processing specialist
        temperature: 0.3  # Moderate temperature for structured data handling
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Implement data-processing pipelines, connectors to diverse data
          sources, and transformation logic for analytics.
      - name: anthropic/claude-3-haiku
        count: 2  # Documentation and test specialists
        temperature: 0.4  # Balanced temperature for clear documentation
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Produce comprehensive documentation plus unit and integration tests
          covering the full analytics workflow.
    temperature: 0.4  # Default temperature (overridden by model-specific settings)
