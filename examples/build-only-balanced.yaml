# Build-Only Balanced Configuration
# This configuration focuses exclusively on build agents with a balanced mix of models
# for different complexity tasks.

# Project metadata
project:
  name: balanced-build-demo

# Builder agents configuration with multiple OpenRouter models
build:
  # High-level objective shared by **all** builder agents
  overarching_team_goal: >
    Build a web-based content-management system that combines a clean,
    accessible front-end with a robust, well-documented Python/JavaScript
    backend and a scalable database schema.
  agents:
    count: 4  # Total number of builder agents
    # Define specific models and how many agents use each
    models:
      - name: openai/gpt-4o
        count: 1  # 1 agent for complex architectural decisions
        temperature: 0.2  # Lower temperature for more precise architectural decisions
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Focus on complex architectural decisions, API design,
          and relational database schema modelling.
      - name: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
        count: 2  # 2 agents for main implementation work
        temperature: 0.5  # Balanced creativity for implementation
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Implement the core business logic, backend services,
          and ensure adherence to the overarching architectural vision.
      - name: openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
        count: 1  # 1 agent for simpler tasks
        temperature: 0.7  # Higher temperature for more varied solutions to simple tasks
        individual_agent_goal: >
          Provide utility functions, helper methods, documentation comments,
          and simpler CRUD endpoints to support the main services.
    temperature: 0.5  # Default temperature (overridden by model-specific settings)

    max_cost_usd: 10.0  # Reasonable budget for a mixed model approach
